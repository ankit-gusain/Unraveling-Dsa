LC:81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicate values) and a target value k. Now the array is rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Return True if k is present and otherwise, return False. 

Pre-requisite: Search Element in Rotated Sorted Array I & Binary Search algorithm

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format:
arr = [7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6], k = 3
Result:
True
Explanation:
The element 3 is present in the array. So, the answer is True.

Example 2:
Input Format:
arr = [7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6], k = 10
Result:
False
Explanation:
The element 10 is not present in the array. So, the answer is False. G
